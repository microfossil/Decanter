# Decanter

## New 12 x 12 mm x 8 tanks Decanter and slide guide
The DecanteurRad12x12x8.stl and Slide_guide.stl files are introduced in the "A new automated radiolarian image acquisition, stacking, processing, segmentation, and identification workflow" publication.

This 3D printable decanter was designed for random settling of particles (coccoliths, radiolarians, benthic foraminiferal fragments…) on 8 standard 12 x 12 mm microscope cover slides.

Up to 3.5 ml of solution containing the particles you want to randomly settle on your cover slides can be dropped into each well.
