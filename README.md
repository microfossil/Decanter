# Decanter

## New Decanter and slide guide
The New_decanter.stl and Slide_guide.stl files are introduced in the "A new automated radiolarian image acquisition, stacking, processing, segmentation, and identification workflow" publication.

This 3D printable decanter was designed for random settling of particles (coccoliths, radiolarians, benthic foraminiferal fragments…) on 8 standard 12 x 12 mm microscope cover slides.

Up to 3.5 ml of solution containing the particles you want to randomly settle on your cover slides can be dropped into each well.
